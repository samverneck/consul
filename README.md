This is the opensource code repository of the eParticipation website originally developed for the Madrid City government eParticipation website

## Current state

Development started on [2015 July 15th](https://github.com/consul/consul/commit/8db36308379accd44b5de4f680a54c41a0cc6fc6). Code was deployed to production on 2015 september 7th to [decide.madrid.es](https://decide.madrid.es). Since then new features are added often. You can take a look at a roadmap and future features in the [open issues list](https://github.com/consul/consul/issues).

## Tech stack

The application backend is written in the [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) using the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework.

Frontend tools used include [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) over [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for the styles.

## Configuration for development and test environments

Prerequisites: install git, Ruby 2.2.3, bundler gem, ghostscript and PostgreSQL (>=9.4).

```
git clone https://github.com/consul/consul.git
cd consul
bundle install
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml
rake db:create
bin/rake db:setup
bin/rake db:dev_seed
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup
```

Run the app locally:
```
bin/rails s

```

Prerequisites for testing: install PhantomJS >= 1.9.8

Run the tests with:

```
bin/rspec
```

You can use the default admin user from the seeds file:

 **user:** admin@madrid.es
 **pass:** 12345678

But for some actions like voting, you will need a verified user, the seeds file also includes one:

 **user:** verified@madrid.es
 **pass:** 12345678

### OAuth

To test authentication services with external OAuth suppliers - right now Twitter, Facebook and Google - you'll need to create an "application" in each of the supported platforms and set the *key* and *secret* provided in your *secrets.yml*

In the case of Google, verify that the APIs *Contacts API* and *Google+ API* are enabled for the application.
